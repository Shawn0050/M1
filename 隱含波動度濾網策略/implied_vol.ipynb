    "# 隱含波動度濾網策略 (買權ATM價格=0.4* S * 買權ATM隱含波動度 *deltaT)\n",
    "### 摘要：\n",
    "本策略參考112選擇權_評價與應用（江彌修）上課內容，結合Implied Vol.透露市場對行情的預期，建構濾網策略，協助提升選擇權演算法交易報酬。\n",
    "### 估計方法與資料處理：\n",
    "1. 使用yfinance抓取台灣加權股價指數(^TWII)做為標的資產代理變數\n",
    "2. 將1.的資料與/atm_option_settle.csv 合併\n",
    "3. 使用次週週選結算價判斷估計「隱含波動度」\n",
    "### 策略內容：\n",
    "1. 判斷次週週選之「隱含波動度」有無大於指定條件，若有則進場直到下一期的次週週選，屆時再進行一次判斷，以此類推。\n",
    "2. 分別建構三種策略：(1) +Call (2) +Put (3) +Call+Put\n",
    "### 策略評估：\n",
    "總合考量下列五指標，\n",
    "1. 總報酬率\n",
    "2. 年化報酬率\n",
    "3. 年化波動率\n",
    "4. 年化夏普值\n",
    "5. 最大回撤(MDD)\n",
    "### 研究發現：\n",
    "使用濾網條件下，三種策略的報酬皆有提升，可推斷隱含波動度為一個富有有用資訊的濾網條件。"

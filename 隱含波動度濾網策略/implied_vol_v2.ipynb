    "# 隱含波動度濾網策略\n",
    "### 摘要：\n",
    "本策略參考112選擇權_評價與應用（江彌修）上課內容，結合Implied Vol.透露市場對行情的預期，建構濾網策略，協助提升選擇權演算法交易報酬。\n",
    "### 估計方法與資料處理：\n",
    "1. 使用TradingView會員帳號提供的調整後台指期資料作為標的資產（其價格有調整過換月合約的問題）\n",
    "   （原：使用yfinance抓取台灣加權股價指數(^TWII)做為標的資產代理變數）\n",
    "2. 將1.的資料與/atm_option_settle.csv 合併\n",
    "3. 使用次週週選結算價判斷估計「隱含波動度」 回推：買權ATM價格=0.4* S * 買權ATM隱含波動度 *deltaT\n",
    "### 操作商品與資金配置：\n",
    "1. 操作商品：\n",
    "   1. 台指近週選擇權，低於且最接近的期貨指數的履約價合約\n",
    "   2. 進場後持有到期結算日\n",
    "   3. 結算日以新合約的結算價重新進場\n",
    "2. 交易口數：\n",
    "   1. 口數 = 策略累積資金(金額)/250000（為控制槓桿）\n",
    "   2. 初始資金: 新台幣 1,000,000。\n",
    "   3. 交易成本: 交易成本+滑價成本進出共權利金3點。\n",
    "   4. 回測期間: 2020/1/2 ~ 2023/8/31，共891日。\n",
    "   5. 資料頻率: 日\n",
    "### 策略內容：\n",
    "1. 判斷次週週選之「隱含波動度」有無大於指定條件，若有則進場直到下一期的次週週選，屆時再進行一次判斷，以此類推。\n",
    "2. 分別建構三種策略：\n",
    "   (1) +Call (2) +Put (3) +Call+Put (4) +Call-Put (5) 大盤buy&hold\n",
    "### 績效評估：\n",
    "總合考量下列五指標，\n",
    "   總報酬率、\n",
    "   年化報酬率、\n",
    "   年化波動率、\n",
    "   年化夏普值、\n",
    "   最大回撤(MDD)\n",
    "1. +call\n",
    "   1. 總報酬率: 46.97%\n",
    "   2. 年化報酬率: 11.67%\n",
    "   3. 年化波動率: 17.96%\n",
    "   4. 年化夏普值: 0.65\n",
    "   5. 最大回撤(MDD): -18.33%\n",
    "2. +put\n",
    "   1. 總報酬率: -40.92%\n",
    "   2. 年化報酬率: -14.01%\n",
    "   3. 年化波動率: 23.49%\n",
    "   4. 年化夏普值: -0.6\n",
    "   5. 最大回撤(MDD): -63.4%\n",
    "3. +call+put\n",
    "   1. 總報酬率: -11.89%\n",
    "   2. 年化報酬率: -3.56%\n",
    "   3. 年化波動率: 25.28%\n",
    "   4.  年化夏普值: -0.14\n",
    "   5.  最大回撤(MDD): -45.02%   \n",

    "   3. 年化波動率: 30.56%\n",
    "   4. 年化夏普值: 0.41\n",
    "   5. 最大回撤(MDD): -54.67%\n",
    "5.  TWII buy and hold\n",
    "    1. 總報酬率: 37.47%\n",
    "    2. 年化報酬率: 9.43%\n",
    "    3. 年化波動率: 18.60%\n",
    "    4. 年化夏普比率: 0.51\n",
    "    5.  最大回撤 (MDD): -31.63%\n",

    "### 研究發現：\n",
    "在看多的情況下交易，+call、+call-put等濾網策略可以在績效上打敗大盤，其中+call濾網策略更是在所有的評估指標上都打敗大盤。\n",
    "在(部分)看空的情況下交易，+put、+call+put等濾網策略皆無法打敗大盤。\n",
    "以上結論符合預期，因濾網策略本身就是在篩選市場預期方向的策略，由於大盤長期看多，看多的濾網策略便可以篩選有用資訊，賺取報酬，而看空的濾網資訊，則無法。"
